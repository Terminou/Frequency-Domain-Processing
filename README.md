# Frequency-Domain-Processing
In this assignment, we are asked to use and test given input images by applying frequency domain processing techniques and compare them with different parameters. In the first part, we required to smoothing the image using frequency domain filters by applying the Ideal low pass filter, Butterworth low pass filter, and gaussian low pass filter. Then in the second part, we should have repeated similar processes as the first one since we needed to use frequency-domain for image sharpening. Yet, this time, I applied three types of high pass filters for sharpening. Lastly, for the third part, we are asked to use notch filters to suppress Moire patterns from input images. A detailed explanation of the steps is in the [report](https://github.com/Terminou/Frequency-Domain-Processing/blob/master/CMPE362%20HW3%20Report.pdf).
